# Smite Solver

# Usage

This program is to be used with my custom [Smite API wrapper](https://github.com/JKal24/smite-api-wrapper).
It can extract data and present it in a more digestible way.
It will give character breakdowns, leaderboards for winrates, banrates and pickrates, and other common data.
